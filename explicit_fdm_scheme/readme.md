# Explicit FDM Scheme for Coupled Fractional Diffusion (`explicit.py`)

This document describes the implementation of an **explicit Finite Difference Method (FDM)** for a 2D **coupled fractional-in-time diffusion system**, commonly used to represent the **Local Thermal Non-Equilibrium (LTNE)** model.

The discretization uses the **L1 scheme** for the Caputo fractional time derivative and **second-order central differences** for the spatial Laplacian.  
As an explicit method, it is simple to implement but **conditionally stable** and computationally expensive due to the non-local history term.  
It is mainly intended for **small-scale validation and educational** purposes.

## Numerical Discretization

The explicit scheme is derived by discretizing the PDEs at time \( t*n \) and solving for the unknown state at \( t*{n+1} \).

### L1 Time Discretization

The Caputo fractional derivative \( \frac{\partial^\alpha \theta}{\partial t^\alpha} \) at time \( t\_{n+1} \) is approximated by the L1 scheme.  
Rearranging the L1 formula to solve for \( \theta^{n+1} \) explicitly gives the update structure:

\[
\frac{\partial^\alpha \theta}{\partial t^\alpha} \Big|\_{n+1}
\approx
\frac{1}{\text{cofactor}}
\left[ (\theta^{n+1} - \theta^n) + \text{History}(n) \right]
\]

where:

- **Cofactor:**  
  \[
  \text{cofactor} = \Gamma(2-\alpha)\, (\Delta t)^\alpha
  \]

- **History Sum:**  
  \[
  \text{History}(n) = \sum\_{k=1}^{n} c_k \, (\theta^{n-k+1} - \theta^{n-k})
  \]

- **L1 Coefficients:**  
  \[
  c_k = (k+1)^{1-\alpha} - k^{1-\alpha}
  \]

### Explicit Update Equations

Substituting the L1 scheme into the governing PDEs and solving for \( \theta^{n+1} \) gives the update equations at each grid point \((i,j)\):

\[
\theta*{s,i,j}^{n+1} =
\theta*{s,i,j}^n

- \text{History}\_s(n)

* \frac{\text{cofactor}}{Fh*s}
  \left[
  \nabla^2 \theta*{s,i,j}^n - \text{InterfaceTerm}\_{i,j}^n
  \right]
  \]

\[
\theta*{f,i,j}^{n+1} =
\theta*{f,i,j}^n

- \text{History}\_f(n)

* \frac{\text{cofactor}}{Fh*f}
  \left[
  \nabla^2 \theta*{f,i,j}^n + \text{InterfaceTerm}\_{i,j}^n
  \right]
  \]

where  
\( \nabla^2 \theta \) is approximated using **second-order central differences**, and  
the **interface term** models heat exchange between phases.

## Stability Condition

The explicit scheme is **conditionally stable**.  
The time step \( \Delta t \) must satisfy the following conditions for both solid and fluid phases:

\[
\Delta t^\alpha
\leq
\frac{Fh_s}{
\Gamma(2-\alpha)
\left[
D_s \left(\frac{4}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{4}{\Delta y^2}\right) + 1
\right]}
\]

\[
\Delta t^\alpha
\leq
\frac{Fh_f}{
\Gamma(2-\alpha)
\left[
D_f \left(\frac{4}{\Delta x^2} + \frac{4}{\Delta y^2}\right) + 1
\right]}
\]

Violation of these conditions leads to numerical instability (manifested as `NaN` or overflow values).

> **Note:** \( D_s \) and \( D_f \) are the effective diffusivities for the solid and fluid domains.

---

## Computational Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**  
  \[
  O(N_x \, N_y \, N_t^2)
  \]
  due to the history termâ€™s discrete convolution (recomputed at each time step).

- **Space Complexity:**  
  \[
  O(N_x \, N_y \, N_t)
  \]
  since the L1 scheme requires storing full temporal histories for both \( \theta_s \) and \( \theta_f \).

---

## Planned Improvements

1. **Fast L1 (SOE):**  
   Replace the direct history sum with a _Sum-of-Exponentials_ (SOE) approximation for \( t^{-\alpha} \), reducing the per-step cost from \( O(N_t) \) to \( O(\log N_t) \) or \( O(1) \).

2. **Vectorization / JIT Compilation:**  
   Use **NumPy vectorization** or **Numba (`@jit`)** to accelerate spatial loops over \((i,j)\).

3. **Implicit Scheme:**  
   Develop an implicit variant (planned under `fdm_solver/`) that is **unconditionally stable**, allowing larger time steps without violating stability constraints.

## Usage Instructions

1. Define physical and grid parameters (`Nx`, `Ny`, `dt`, `alpha`, `Fhs`, etc.) at the top of `explicit.py`.
2. Ensure `dt` satisfies the stability condition above.
3. Run the solver:

   ```bash
   python explicit.py
   ```
